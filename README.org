* CDL
Work with the Cropland Data Layer (CDL) dataset

** Dataset Description
The CDL is available for download either through the [[http://datagateway.nrcs.usda.gov/][USDA NRCS
Geospatial Data Gateway]] or the [[http://nassgeodata.gmu.edu/CropScape/][USDA NASS CropScape web site]].  We
currently use CropScape.  One advantage of this is that the data is
made available per county all using the same Albers Equal Area
projection.

Extensive metadata is available [[http://www.nass.usda.gov/research/Cropland/metadata/meta.htm][here]].

** Codeset Description
This repository can be found [[https://github.com/nbest937/cdl][here]] on [[https://github.com][GitHub]].

This repository is an example of a Blox component.  Blox is a modular
source code management, data management and scientific workflow
concept under development at the University of Chicago's Computation
Institute.  Blox currently relies on the Git distributed version
control system and GNU Make, but could conceivably be implemented
using other source code management systems and dependency tracking
utilities.
